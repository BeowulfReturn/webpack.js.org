1. Check the existing issues to see if you can find something matching to your request.
2. If your issue concerns the [voting application](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/voting-app) or loader/plugin documentation, please first consider opening an issue in the corresponding repository instead.
3. If you didn't find a relevant issue, go ahead and open a new one. It's better to make small typo fixes and such directly as pull requests.
